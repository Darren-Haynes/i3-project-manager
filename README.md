# i3 Project Manager

I use [i3wm][https://i3wm.org] and this project manager helps me manage my projects. 

* Command line tool that lets you open your projects from the command line.
* Save the project by saving the layout of your windows/apps.
* Save the project as specific 'type` (such as python) to open specific files in vim/gvim automatically when loading the project. Note this is presently catered to my very specific workflow and for vim. Future plans to make numerous templates for users to choose from.
